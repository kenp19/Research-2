<br>
<p>Mobile telephone has a long history that started off with experiments of communications from and to moving vehicle rather than handheld devices. <br> The first successful mobile phone service was offered to first class passengers on the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Dr Martin Cooper <br> general manager at Motorola communications system division made the first public mobile phone call on a device that weighed 1.1Kg in 1973. <br>  The world’s first SMS message was sent in the UK by Neil Papworth, a developer for a telecom contractor. <br> The text message read “Merry Christmas” and was sent to Richard Jarvis, a director at Vodafone. <br> The first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was a ringtone, by Finland’s Radiolinja. <br> Emojis were introduced by Shigetaka Kurita in Japan. Around this time, because of the shots fired in a supermarket price war, <br> you could pick up a mobile phone for just under £40. The first blackberry phone was unveiled in 1999. <br> It was known for its easy email service. This led to 83% of users reading and responding to work emails all the time. </p>

<h1>Macintosh</h1>
<br>

<br>
<p>The Macintosh, or Mac, is a series of several lines of personal computers, manufactured by Apple. <br> The first Macintosh was introduced January 24, 1984 by Steve Jobs. <br> The Macintosh project started in the late 1970s with Jef Raskin, an Apple employee. <br> He originally wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but it had to be changed regarding to legal reasons. <br> The first Macintosh board had 64 kilobytes. It was designed by Burrell Smith. <br> Apple spent $2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages. The limitations of the first Mac soon became clear. <br> It had very little memory, even compared with other personal computers in 1984. <br> Apple increased the Mac’s memory in October 1985, but it was inconvenient and difficult to expand. <br> Apple then released the Macintosh Plus on January 1986 for $2600. The Macintosh was targeted for two primary markets: knowledge-workers and students. </p>

<h1>Windows</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<img src="./images/windows.jpg" alt="window" class="center" text align="center"
<br>
<p>The original Windows 1 was released in November 1985 and it was Microsoft’s first attempt at a graphical user interface in 16-bit. <br> To help users become familiar with this odd input system, Microsoft included a game, Reversi, <br> which relied on mouse control, not the keyboard. <br> This was aimed to get people used to moving the mouse around and clicking onscreen elements. <br> Microsoft’s Windows 2 replaced Windows 1 in December 1987, two years after its release. <br> Microsoft Word and Excel made their first appearances running on Windows 2. <br> Windows 3 was the first version to see more widespread success. It was considered a challenger to Apple’s Macintosh. <br> Windows 3 introduced the ability to run MS-DOS programs in windows. This brought multitasking to legacy programs. <br> Windows 95 arrived in August 1955 and it brought the first ever Start button and Start menu. <br> Windows 10 – despite being the ninth version of Windows – is designed to unify all Windows platforms across multiple devices.   </p>

<h1>Television</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<img src="./images/television.jpg" alt="television" class="center" text align="center"
<br>
<p>Electronic television was first successfully introduced in San Francisco in September 1927. <br> The system was designed by Philo Taylor Farnsworth. The company that dominated the radio business in the United States, <br> invested $50 million in the development of electronic television. <br> Early television was primitive. All the action at that first televised baseball game had <br> to be captured by one single camera. Television’s progress was further slowed by a struggle over wavelength allocations <br> with the new FM radio. In 1953-1955, television programming began to take some steps away from radio formats. <br> In the 1980s, home videocassette recorders became widely available. The viewers gained ability to record and replay programs. <br> The number of cable networks grew throughout the 1980s and then exploded in the 1990s. <br> Although the population of the US was continued to grow, the Nielon Media Research Company estimated <br> that fewer people watched the highly publicized final episode of Seinfield. </p>

<h1>Cellphones</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<img src="./images/phone.jpg" alt="phone" class="center" text align="center"
<br>
<p>Cell phones were originally created so that people could talk while they drove. These phones were initially <br> called “car phones”. The world’s first cell phone was launched in 1983. This was the Motorola DynaTAC 800x. <br> This was priced at around $4,000. The talk time before dying lasted for about 30 minutes. <br> The Motorola was the size of a foot long sub from Subway. Although the phone size was large, <br> it was still considered to be the most portable telephone ever made. A human could call someone without the constraints of wires or portable phone holders. <br> The original Mobile Telephone Service was soon supplanted by Improved Mobile Telephone Service. In an effort to compete with AT&T, <br> independent American telephone companies introduced the Radio Common Carrier. This system used frequencies near <br> the IMTS frequencies. Europe, like America, developed its own series of mobile radio networks. <br> In 1973, 10 years before a cell was released, the first cell phone was made by Martin Cooper. </p>
